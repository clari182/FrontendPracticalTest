        <p>This page has been made for an eventual position at PedidosYa. It is a test that has been designed by PedidosYa to determine the Frontend developer&#39;s skills. It was ask to do the following: </br>
          <h3>Create a website (could be a single page navigation or different pages) with the
            following sections:</h3>

                      and when pressed should delete the cookie and show the Login option again.</a>
                    </div>
                    <h3>How was it done?</h3>
                    <p>The developing of this page has been done following specific steps that I believe must be done in every developing situation.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span class="badge">1</span>Problem analysis</h4>
                    <p>The first step of software developing is understanding the problem. What is asked of us? For this test it was mainly reading the test subject and trying to understand every step and item needed to be developed. This is where, personally, the visualization of the page comes. This is when I see how the page will look like. This is surely going to change while I design the solution but it helps me have a vision of the end product.</p>
                    <h4><span class="badge">2</span>Different technologies analysis</h4>
                    <p>Not every technology is useful for every problem. It&#39;s important to keep this in mind. Sometimes we know a technology so well that we want to put it everywhere. However sometimes it&#39;s the wrong one for the job.</br>
                      For this test I analyzed pure Jquery without using any framework, using BackboneJS, JavascriptMVC, HTML5, CSS and CSS3 and Bootstrap. </br>
                      All of this technologies were appealing to me and I&#39;ve decided to use all of them in some way, except JavascriptMVC. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><span class="badge">3</span>Designing a solution</h4>
                    <p>So far, I&#39;ve decided to use: Pure jQuery, BackboneJs, HTML5, CSS and CSS3 and Bootstrap.
                    </br>The next thing I wanted to do is to divide every task in a section, and be able to navigate through those sections.
                  </br>This is why I decided to put a header bar using the one provided by Bootstrap. To navigate through the sections, I used the Backbone Router (AppRouter.js). I also used a Backbone View for the behavior of all the sections. (AppView.js for sections home, About me, Html5, CSS3 and Performance and MapView.js for the javascript section).
                </br>Finally for the login, I used pure jQuery to control the cookie (CookieHandler.js)          
              </p>
              <h4><span class="badge">4</span>Defining a schedule</h4>
              <p>This step is purely personal. I analyzed how much time was given, how was my personal schedule for this time to define when I was going to implement it.</p>
              <h4><span class="badge">5</span>Implementing the solution</h4>
              <p>I don&#39;t think there is much to say about this part :) 
              </br>Just putting into code what was planned.
              </p>
              <h4><span class="badge">6</span>Testing the solution</h4>
              <p>Must.. Test.. Everythiiing! Foreveeer! Well, until Monday at least.</p>
              </p>

    <h1 class="page-header">About me</h1>
    <p>Hey! What&#39;s up?!</br>
      My name is Clara Youdale, I&#39;m a 25 years old French girl born in Cannes but living in Uruguay for the past 15 years. So I feel as Uruguayan as French.
    </br>I&#39;m a software developer by chance! What do I mean? I&#39ll explain... The story begins a long time ago in a galaxy far far away...
  </br><img src="css/img/star_wars.gif" style="padding:10px;"/>        
</br>Just kidding! This is the real story: I&#39;m a developer by chance because when I was about to finish highschool I had literally no idea what I wanted to do with my life... But, one cold winter morning, I went happily (not) to highschool and ORT University had left a poster about a free programming workshop. And since I had nothing to lose, I went! And I loved it! <img src="css/img/heart.png" style="width:30px;height:30px;"/>
</br>So the next year I started and now I&#39;m an engineer. <img src="css/img/hat.png" style="width:30px;height:30px;"/></p>
<h3 class="page-header">First job</h3>
<p>The second year of the career I took a job in a french company that sells a CRM, and I learned a lot!
  I was mainly a backend developer, programming with Delphi. In my last year I started working in the UI part of the software, because we were changing everything from naked Javascript to jQuery. Aaaaand, UI never left me since then. I really feel that I&#39;ve found the right branch and I hope I will always learn new ways to work with it.
</p>
<h3 class="page-header">Second job</h3>
<p>Three years later I took a new job at Globant where I learned even more! There I learned all about frameworks, mainly BackboneJs. I worked there for one year and a half but I had to quit because I wanted to finish my career and working 8 hours was making it harder. So, I quit, finished my career and went to Europe for 4 months. You can see all about the places I&#39;ve been in the <a href="#javascriptt">Javascript</a> section!</p>
<h3 class="page-header">Third job</h3>
<p>PedidosYa hopefully! :)</p>

    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML5 has optimized a lot of our daily work. I am going to explain de 3 new features that had the major impact on my work. They are mainly oriented to inputs.</p>        
    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Required<h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Before Html5, every time you needed to have a mandatory input, it was essential to have some javascript behind to control that the input was not empty.
          </br>Required is an attribute that can be associated with a lot of input types. Its main purpose is to verify that the field is not empty when the form is submitted. No need for extra code. This is why I think this feature is important, it saves a lot of time programation wise.
        </br>This is the code example:
        <div class="bs-example"><pre>&lt;input type="date" required/&gt;</pre></div>                  
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title">Pattern for regex</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
     <p>In one of my job, we had a project with a client that needed a lot of special information being entered in different section of the application.
      Some of this information had to follow a specific pattern or contain a specific quantity of numbers and/or special characters. It was very useful to have the pattern property witch allows you to avoid any unnecessary javascript code to control what the input was filled with. So, the pattern is used for regular expressions and is defined directly in the input. For the next example I am going to use a simple regex to verify that the input is an email address: </br>
    </p>
    <div><pre><code>&lt;input type="email" pattern="\b&#91;A-Z0-9._%+-&#93;+@&#91;A-Z0-9.-&#93;+\.&#91;A-Z&#93{2,4}\b"&#47;&gt;</code></pre></div>            
  </div>        
</div>
<div class="panel panel-info">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Editable contents<h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>This feature is very important for me because it enhances the dynamic part of the UI and the site becomes a lot more user friendly. For example when you go to your profile on some social media, sometimes you want to edit something, and going to Settings > Edit or just click on the Edit button can be a little bit annoying sometimes. If the content is editable you just need to click on what you want to change and change it and that is it! No need for extra clicks. We used a similar approach in one of our project but without the property, witch was very hard to accomplish. We had to do some javascript behind that would capture de click event and hide the label and show an input instead. With the editablecontent property you can just add it to the input and it will automatically do all the work for you. So I think this feature is important for users but also for programmers.</p>
      <div><pre><code>
        &lt;div class="editable-div" contenteditable="true"&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
      </code></pre></div>            
    </div>        
  </div>   
</div>

<script type="text/html" id="css3-template">

  <h2>CSS3</h2>  
  <p>This section is about 3 new features of CSS3. I have chosen features that I have used at work or at school and that helped to create pages more easily and quickly. The features that I am going to mention are Columns, Media queries and Text overflow. There are a lot more features that are very useful with UI developing but this three are the ones I have used the most.</p> 
  <div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title">Columns<h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>This CSS3 feature allows you to divide a text in different columns. Before this feature, it was
          necessary to do this manually via css properties. This is useful when you want your text to appear in a specific section and display it as if it was a newspaper article.
          For example, if you have a div but you would like to separated it in various columns you just need to do as follow in your css file:
          <div class='css3-columns-example-code'><pre><code>.columns-example {
            -webkit-column-count: 3; &#47;* For browsers Chrome, Safari and Opera *&#47;
            -moz-column-count: 3; &#47;* Firefox *&#47;
            column-count: 3;
            -webkit-column-width: 100px; &#47;* For browsers Chrome, Safari and Opera *&#47;
            column-width: 100px;
          }</code></pre></div>
          <h4>And now the example with this styling:</h4>            
          <div class="columns-example">Et dixit ad hanc primam css3 pluma. Dicitur columna et pluma sino vos ut aliquid diversum dividunt textum quinae denae. Similis omnibus locis faciunt nonnulli textus suus arāneārum ut exemplum est ut faciam. Forsit est ut diu scribere text funcionalidades ita ostendi potest proprie. Iustus sum scribens verba temere Nunc intellegi potest ita spero. Etenim me movet quam hoc legistis anglicus in finem! The text ut miris modis translatus ad anglicus. Ita hic ire vivo exemplo rem css3 column.</div>            
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Media queries</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
       <p>The media queries are used to change the styling of a page if something specific happens. For example, I want the styling to change ONLY if the page is viewed on a mobile phone, so I apply a media query that will trigger when this is satisfy. This is very useful when you want the page to adapt to different condition and maintaining a dynamic look. I have used this for my thesis with our website to adjust some styling to the mobile and tablet views of it. Not only for sizing, but for example for colors. We saw that sometimes things look pretty on a web page with certain colors, but when in mobile version, the result can look messy and unintuitive. This is why we used media queries, so when it was detected that the user was watching the site in a mobile browser, the colors (and other properties) would change to make it look prettier.
        For example, if you want to change a color when the page is looked in a smaller version, this is what you should do:
      </p>
      <div><pre><code>
        .media-queries-example {
          background-color: #E0E0E0;            
        }
        .media-queries-example:after{
          content: "Light panel example";
        }

        @media (min-width: 700px) {
          .media-queries-example {
            background-color: #484848;          
          }
          .media-queries-example:after{
            content: "Dark panel example";
          }
        }</code></pre></div>
        <p>Now the live example. You see a panel with dark grey. When you reduce the browser, the color will change.</p>
        <div class="panel panel-default">
          <div class="panel-body media-queries-example">
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>        
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Text overflow<h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Text overflow is a feature of CSS3 that gives a nice styling when some text does not fit in its holder. I used this a lot in one of my job because we had some information that was sometimes to long to show, and the overflow property allowed us to cut this information showing the client that there was still more to read. It is a direct technique without adding extra javascript behind to control this behavior. The code is as easy as shown now:</p>
          <div><pre><code>
            .overflow-example {
              width: 100px;
              border: 1px solid black;
              overflow: hidden;
              text-overflow: ellipsis;  
            }</code></pre></div>
            <p>And now the live example:</p>
            <p class="overflow-example">This is a long text that needs to be cut because it does not fit in the box</p>
          </div>

        <h3 class="panel-title">Minify files<h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>When you create a web application there is always javascript and css code, normally in different files (you should try to separate it from the html). Those files can be heavy for the site and can occur in slow loading which can be a negative point for the user using it. One technique that can help the site load faster and move faster in all its section is minifying the javascript and css files (you can even minify the html files). The minifying process will not alter any of the functionality of the file, just remove unnecessary code, rename variables with smaller name and a lot of other things. The resulting file will not be easy (at all) to read for the developer, so this is mainly done when the application is going to production where there is no need to look at the code anymore. For this page, I did not minify the javascript, html and css files that I have created so you can still read them. However, I have used the minified versions of libraries and frameworks on which the application depends on.

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
        <p>This technique is strongly related to minimizing the number of HTTP requests the site does. Every time you need to load an image, this loading does a request. What sprite does is reunite several images in only one so there is only one HTTP request made for all the images. This helps improving the performance of the web application. However it can be hard to create a Sprite for the first time but there are a lot of tools that can help you do it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I think it is important to save in the cache as much as information as possible. The first time the sites loads, it should be as fast as possible for the first time users, but it is also important to think about the second time users that will reenter the site. If the information is cached, the site will be a lot faster, without needing to re-load data. Web browsers and servers allows you to do this.</p>

          <p>Hey there! This popup gives you the possibility to login and save it in a cookie. You just need to click on the button.</p>
          <p>You can reload the page and still be logged in (the cookie name is "username"). If you click on Logout, the cookie will be destroyed and the cookie monster will starve.</p>

            <strong>Warning!</strong> Since the site isn't published yet you must try this function on IE or Firefox. Chrome doesn't allow cookie saving from local files.
            You can also start chrome with the --enable-file-cookies flag and it will work.
